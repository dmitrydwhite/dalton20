      <p>I want to be your Oregon House Representative for District 19 for all of the right reasons. First, and foremost, this election is an opportunity for your voice to be heard and your concerns and suggestions to be given serious attention by someone who has lived in our District for 13 years and has demonstrated a commitment to the betterment of our community. Now I need your support to enhance and expand on a larger scale that which I have voluntarily done on an individual basis. The issues which have propelled me to take this step are rooted in what I view as opportunities not problems. Amongst them is the promise that lies before us to nurture economic advancement and the standard of living for all Oregonians. We must ensure that businesses are encouraged to settle here and grow in the provision of quality goods and services while being mindful and considerate of both our natural and human environments. By taking such an approach, we build employment opportunities and ancillary benefits for our citizens.</p>

      <p>Second, our educational systems need support to educate our people at all stages of life inclusive of preschool thru retirement years. We need to look forward and plan accordingly so that the subjects and skills taught today prepare and enhance our workforce of tomorrow to meet and successfully compete in a global economy. We must call upon our seniors and retired citizens to again actively engage in our forward movement by mentoring and participating in the betterment of our community.</p>

      <p>Third, our citizens individually and collectively deserve and should have access to the highest quality of life possible rooted in a public health and public safety agenda that assures both a safe and healthy community. Here I bring leadership experience that does not compromise where life and the well-being of people are at risk. To do so, I will advance and support legislative agendas that focus on a triad of health and safety including prevention, intervention, and monitoring.</p>

      <p>There are, and will be, many more opportunities for us to develop a responsive, viable, safe, and healthy Oregon. It is my desire and intent to bring years of community experience as a professional and as a volunteer in identifying needs, developing collaborative solutions, assuring the effective and efficient implementation of resources, and preparing for a better future. This lies at the heart of my commitment to you. I will serve every citizen, engage every possibility, and promote a secure and vibrant future for Oregon. Please join me in the promise. Together we can do better for all of our citizens.</p>

      <p>Thank You for your consideration. I welcome your questions, comments, and involvement.</p>
